# Moonriver Explorer
A three-js, real-time window into transactions from the last 20 blocks on Moonriver, hacked together in two days

## Setup
To get this working, you will need a free api url/key from a Moonriver provider. I went with On Finality: https://app.onfinality.io. Create a "private" folder in the project's root folder, and put the api key/url in a .env file in this folder. E.g.: WS_URL=[your api key/url]

## Credits
This was my first time using three.js, and the following examples were immensely useful: https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples.

Thanks is also due to Anastasia Goodwin for her "twinkling stars" codepen: https://codepen.io/agoodwin/pen/NMJoER.
